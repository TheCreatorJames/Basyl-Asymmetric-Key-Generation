### Welcome
Modern Cryptography is the future. Asymmetric Encryption provides us with the ability to do amazing things, like safely communicate with our banks, or our friends. This tool is a way of making modern cryptography more accessible to the average user. How, you might ask? This project allows you to generate RSA and EC keys from a password, or even a file. 

It is strongly recommended you check out our other page.

### But wait, isn't this insecure?
To be honest, not really. The thought of being able to re-generate your key from a password is unfamiliar to most cryptographers. This is because most generation schemes use hardware and user generated randomness to generate keys, making it impossible to replicate. The Basyl AKG uses an algorithm that gives the same consistently high entropy in a very secure fashion. When encrypting with other (symmetric) algorithms, you usually use a password anyways. No one complains then.
